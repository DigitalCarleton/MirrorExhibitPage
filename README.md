# MirrorExhibitPage
An Omeka plugin to mirror exhibit pages using the exhibit page layout.

This plugin adds the "Mirror Layout" option to the exhibit builder page editor. To mirror any exhibit page, simply create a new exhibit page, add a Mirror Layout block, and select the page that you want to mirror from the menu, organized by exhibit.

You can add other blocks to a mirror page around the Mirror Layout block, but you can only have one Mirror Layout block per page.
